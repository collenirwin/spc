Description: A lightweight multiplatform CLI for Spotify (program)
 spc Go
 .
 A lightweight mutliplatform CLI for Spotify InstallationmacOS bash brew
 install dvdmuckle/tap/spc
 .
 Fedora Linux bash sudo dnf copr enable dvdmuckle/spc sudo dnf install spc
 .
 Other Platforms Download one of the releases and unarchive the spc binary
 somewhere in your PATH. Alternatively, download and install with:
 .
 go get -u github.com/dvdmuckle/spc
 .
 Make sure $GOPATH/bin is in your PATH for this to work.  Setup To
 set up the app, run spc config to generate a skeleton config file at
 ~/.config/spc/config.yaml. Next, head to http://developer.spotify.com/
 to create a new Spotify app. Make sure to set a callback URL for
 http://localhost:8888/callback. Paste the ClientID and ClientSecret in
 the config as noted. You can now run spc auth to start the OAuth2 flow,
 which will have you grant the Spotify app you created, and thus spc,
 the correct API permissions.  Running Because this app is in constant
 development, please refer to spc help for what functionality is available
 in the app.  Goals The goal of this project is to present a simple,
 lightweight command line interface for Spotify, inspired by spotify-tui
 (https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui). Support for play, pause,
 volume, and a simple search are all that are considered right now. The
 roadmap may change in the future.  Roadmap | Feature | Implemented yet? |
